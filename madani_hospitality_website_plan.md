## 12. Local Cultural Elements to Consider

Yogyakarta is known for its rich cultural heritage. Consider incorporating these elements subtly into your website design:

- **Batik Patterns:** Traditional Javanese batik patterns could be used as subtle background elements or decorative borders
- **Wayang Shadow Puppets:** Silhouettes or stylized elements could be used as icons or decorative elements
- **Borobudur/Prambanan Temples:** Architectural elements could inspire design components
- **Traditional Colors:** Earthy tones of terracotta, deep blues, and natural greens reflect the local landscape
- **Local Crafts:** References to local craftsmanship like silver work, pottery, or woodcarving

These elements should be incorporated tastefully and minimally to maintain the clean, modern aesthetic while giving your website a distinctive sense of place.

## 13. User Journeys

Consider these primary user journeys when designing your website:

1. **Direct Booking Journey:**
   - User discovers website → Browses properties → Views details → Contacts via WhatsApp → Books directly

2. **Comparison Journey:**
   - User finds property on online platform → Searches for property name → Finds your website → Compares prices → Books directly to save fees

3. **Recommendation Journey:**
   - User is recommended by previous guest → Visits website → Explores multiple properties → Contacts for availability → Books via WhatsApp

Ensuring these journeys are smooth and intuitive will help maximize conversions.
